## Overview

Simple calculator with minimal erroring.

- Handles basic arithmetic operations (+ - / *) and nested parens.
- Controlled input significantly reduces the incidence of errors and makes for an intuitive user experience.
- Beginning an entry with just an operator/ decimal will stub out an expression or float for you. Ex: 0+3 or 0.3
- Responsive keypad view highlights user keypresses. 

Premium features under development for paid users:

- Restricted parens entry to prevent unbalanced parens from going to the server.
- Submission of expressions using the command line.

## Usage

Submit entry to the server evaluation with Enter or '='. 
The result is returned to the input field for the user to perform further calculations with (or clear).

Controlled input prohibits entry of any non-numeric or non-operator characters. More than one successive operator is disallowed with the exception of '-', two of which are permitted only when entered between integers (or paren expressions that will evaluate to integers). Only one decimal is permitted per number. Any expression that evaluates to infinity will return 'âˆž' without error, but the next entry will then clear the input field since no further meaningful operations can be performed with infinity (as far as I know).

The only invalid inputs allowed through are (1) unbalanced parens, which are checked on the server and will return an alert for unbalanced parens, and (2) hanging operators, which will likewise return an alert for invalid input.

## Installation

1. Clone down repository.
